As long as you respect the following rules, I accept any pull-request which can improve the extension.

## New Tips
* Add URLs whenever possible.

* Use the public API to document your own extension.

## Code changes
* Indent your code by 2 spaces.
* Document the purpose of functions and classes.
* Document other code where useful.
* When adding a new feature, please mention it in the `README.md` Features section. Use screenshots when applicable.
